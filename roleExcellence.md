# TPM Growth Journey
Through these standards, we envision a growth journey for TPMs that builds on each prior phase to develop increasingly strategic capabilities for TPMs at ISE. It starts with Building Foundations of program management, then grow your ability to drive complex programs, orchestrating execution cross-functional teams, followed by taking high-ambiguity initiatives and leading through complexity, and evolving into an influential leader shaping strategy. This path enables TPMs to expand from mastering fundamentals and driving programs to influencing product design and eventually shaping organizational direction across Microsoft.

## How to use this guidance
TPM Standards are most effective when you use them to:

ðŸŸ¢ Understand expectations at your Role and Career Stage: This is particularly useful for someone new to the role or someone who wants to understand their journey to the next levels.

ðŸŸ¢ Have constructive 1:1s: Use this document to have productive conversations with your manager. It helps identify areas of growth at your current career stage and clarifies whatâ€™s ahead.

ðŸŸ¢ Drive Connect conversations: During Connects, discuss how your core priorities align with the role expectations at ISE. Use this as a basis for development plans and identifying opportunities.

ðŸŸ¢ Get Inspiration from Examples of Impact: Review the examples to see how other TPMs across ISE are creating impact. This can spark ideas for your own growth and help drive meaningful 1:1 discussions with your manager.

Anti-patterns
TPM Standards must NOT be interpreted as:

ðŸ”´ A checklist to high rewards: The guidance is not a prescription or checklist for rewards. Standard Microsoft and ISE rewards and promotion processes still apply.

ðŸ”´ Evidence of performing at next Career Stage: Because TPM engagements vary, not all impacts can be captured here. This is a guide for growth, and managers should use it to align and coach.

ðŸ”´ Not all functions are expected: TPM roles differ based on customer needs, so you may not cover every key function. Managers and TPMs should focus on impact distribution and plan growth opportunities collaboratively.

ðŸ”´ Replace HR Role Library: TPM Standards is ISE expectations and an interpretation of Microsoft HR Role. It is NOT a replacement of Microsoft Role Library.

## TPM Role Level Mapping
Microsoft HR has updated their terminology to use career stages for IC and Manager roles to create consistency across Microsoft. Please find below the level mapping for your career stage and role. We will use Role and Career Stages for TPM Standards. For more details, please refer to Career Stage profile.
